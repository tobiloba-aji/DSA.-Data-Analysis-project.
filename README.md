# DSA.-Data-Analysis-project.
This is the first data analysis project I worked on while learning data Analysis with DSA incubator hub

## Case 3: Gender Inequality analysis using Power bi

### Project Overview:
This project aims to generate insights on claims of Gender inequality in three regions of a company. By analyzing specific parameters in the data received, we seeek to gather enough insight to addressing the claims as well as identifying key areas of managerial focus to promote fair treatment within the company and its regions

### data sources
The data used were XLsx files and csv files supplied by Incubator hub for use in the final course project folder

### Tools used
Power Bi
   - For data transformation
   - Analysis
   - Report creation
### Data preparation and Cleaning
 - In the initial phase of the project, data files was imported individually on the Power bi desktop and the following actions were undertaken
   1. Data loading and inspection
   2. handling of missing variables
     a. Rows with black spaces, empty spaces or null values on the salary column which denoted exited staffs were removed according to the case instruction
     b. Rows with null values on the department column were also removed according to the case instruction
     c. New conditional column labelled "assigned gender" was created for gender to assign gender as "undisclosed" for staffs who did not disclose their gender while retaining appropriate gender information for staffs with dsclosed gender.
   3. Data cleaning and formatting   
- A total of three data files were transformed and sucessfully uploaded
- concatnate newclumn
- merging tables
- new columns with calculations
### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the data to answer some case questions such as;
- What is the gender distribution in the organization distil into regions and 
departments 
- Insights on ratings based on gender 
- Analysing the companyâ€™s salary structure to identify gender pay gap and insights into departments and regions with identified gender pay gap that should be the focus of 
management

-  Total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
